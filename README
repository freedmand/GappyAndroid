GappyAndroid is a very simple Android app that attempts to:
- Run a BroadcastReceiver in the background to capture all incoming SMS messages
- Process those messages into orthogonal sparse bigrams (OSB) or gappy bigrams (GB) based on user defined settings
- Allow user to define maximum gap for OSB/GB
- Allow user to define location for all OSB/GB files to be kept
- Allow user to browse for path as well as directly type in path
- Provide a very simple text viewer to look at OSB/GB files gathered
- Show user rudimentary statistics such as number of SMS captured, size of capture files, etc.
